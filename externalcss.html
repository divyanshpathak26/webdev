        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>  My name is Divyansh Pathak and currently i'm pursuing my Masters in M.C.A. from KIET GROUP OF INSTITUTIONS, GHAZIABAD.
            I had done my Graduation in B.C.A. from Bulandshahr. Through these studies, I have been deepening my knowledge in software development, programming, and various computing technologies. 
            My BCA gave me a solid start in programming and web development, and now my MCA is helping me expand those skills further.
            I am deeply interested in web development and have been focusing on improving my skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to strengthen my problem-solving abilities.
            I'm particularly passionate about working with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to build full-stack web applications. My goal is to combine these skills to create efficient, scalable, and user-friendly web solutions.</p>
